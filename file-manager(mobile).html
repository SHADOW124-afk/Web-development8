    <h1>What is a File Manager?</h1>
    <p>A file manager is a program that allows you to organize and manage files on your computer or device. In web development, file managers are essential for organizing your project files, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.</p>
    <h2>Types of File Managers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Operating System File Managers:</strong> These are built-in file managers like File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac).</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party File Managers:</strong> These are more advanced file managers like Total Commander or Directory Opus. They offer features like dual-pane views, file comparison, and FTP support.</li>
        <li><strong>Online File Managers:</strong> These file managers run in your web browser and are often part of web hosting control panels.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Use a File Manager for Web Development</h2>
    <p>To use a file manager for web development, simply create a new folder for your project and then organize your files within that folder. You can use the file manager to create, rename, copy, move, and delete files as needed.</p>
